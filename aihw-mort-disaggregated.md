### AIHW_Summarised_cause_of_death_2000_2019_disaggregated_version_2



Summarised monthly or daily cause of death mortality data. HIGHLY RESTRICTED Note that the underlying data are not permissible for publication. For information Contact Email: car.data@sydney.edu.au

This data is disaggregated by SA4/LGA/greater capital city aggregations, state, year, month, sex, age group and ICD10 code for 2000–2019.

1. Monthly deaths (state, GCC, SA4, LGA) and daily deaths (GCC) for all-cause and  non-trauma
1. Monthly deaths for respiratory conditions (state, GCC, SA4, LGA) – 
1. Daily deaths for respiratory, cardiovascular and renal diseases by GCC.


Deaths are counted according to death occurrence, note that some deaths are not registered in the same year that it occurred particularly in November and December (e.g. due to late registration or coronial investigation). Hence, deaths in 2019 are underestimated.

Deaths registered in 2017 and earlier are based on the final version of cause of death data; deaths registered in 2018 are based on the revised version; deaths registered in 2019 are based on the preliminary version. Revised and preliminary versions are subject to further revision by the ABS.
